					<br>Hello!
   					<br>My name is Cátia
   				</h1>
   				<p>I am a Berlin-based certified UX Designer with a background in Digital Marketing.
	   			I have worked with a variety of clients from startups to large corporations, helping them understand their digital space, their audience, and which business opportunities are there for them. I’ve done this by listening to their customers and analysing the data to create insights that add value to the business. I believe empathy and collaboration are the basis for intuitive and clever design, and the only way to deliver unique and remarkably positive experiences. I am currently seeking UX opportunities in the Berlin area or remotely that combines my newly acquired technical skills with my experience in research, analytics, and data visualisation. I want to be involved in projects that I can be proud of and join an amazing team that believes cooperation is the right way to evolve and create great products and experiences. If you are interested in helping me make this happen, please get in touch
